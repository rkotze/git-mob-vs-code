Follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Next version

## 1.17.1

### Fixed

- Extension breaks if user name is empty from GitHub [issue 152](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/152). Replaced empty name with `username` (`login` property).

### Note

- CI build step in GitHub actions.
- Add publish step for GitHub actions
- Published to [open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/RichardKotze/git-mob). Addresses [issue 122](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/122).

## 1.17.0

### Added

- Global Git Mob means that you will have the same selected co-authors when switching between projects. Read more on [migrating from local commit template](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/discussions/120).
- Reload icon added to project folder item.
- By default fetch anonymous email from GitHub [issue 101](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/101)

## 1.16.0 -- 2020-03-03

### Added

- Use command palette to select co-authors from unselected and repo contributors [issue 82](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/82) This also enables adding multiple repo contributors at once with the multi-selector command palette.
- Right-click on co-author item and copy co-author to clipboard [issue 79](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/79)
  
### Fixes

- Clean up unused icons and use VS Code provided icons to match the editors UI.
- When selecting a repo contributor from search command palette, fix flow of adding them to selected for co-authoring if setting is enabled.

## 1.15.0 -- 2022-01-22

### Added

- Toggle authors in alphabetical order ascending or descending [issue 73](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/73) - see settings to toggle sort. Thanks to @viperet.
- New core integration tests added using @vscode/test-electron and mocha. Added to Azure CI pipeline.

### Fixes

- Small stability fixes: 
  - app is ready check for tests
  - set git template path on solo function (edge case)


## 1.14.1 -- 2021-11-14

### Fixed

- Cannot read property 'inputBox' of undefined for workspaces [issue 80](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/80) and related [issue 61](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/61). When there are two or more repositories open and Git Mob **cannot** reliably workout the selected repository it fails.
- Author **not** changing when switching between repositories in workspaces.
- Setting the commit template first time usage on a repository was done incorrectly and essentially failing to write the changes into the template file. This prevented the co-author metadata from being added into the inputBox. See [issue 81](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/81)

## 1.14.0 -- 2021-11-09

### Added

- Sort co-author list by alphabetical order in [issue 11](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/11) - thanks to @viperet
- Add co-author from "more authors" directly into "selected" [issue 76](https://github.com/rkotze/git-mob-vs-code/issues/76)

### Fixed

- Listen to repo change event to sync Git Mob UI rather than VS Code UI change events, which run more often even if co-authors have not changed.
- Loosen the author email matcher for "more authors" to ensure all contributors are listed.
- Open extension settings correctly by showing only GitMob settings.
